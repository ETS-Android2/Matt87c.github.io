# Artifact 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures
## What is this artifact?
The artifact chosen for Algorithms and Data Structures will be from the course IT-145 Foundation in Application Development.  This course taught me how to design android applications.  The android application I design is an Inventory application.  This artifact was created in October of 2021.

## Why did I select this artifact?
The inventory app showcases my ability to code in java and efficient at creating android apps with SQLite databases.  

## Enhancements
The enhancements also include a new item in the SQLite database.  I realized that the item name was not part of the inventory app.  I added the item name when adding an item and editing an item.  To add the item name, I had to update the Item java class along with the SQLiteDatabase2.  In the Item java class, I created a new string called itemName in the public class item. I also had to create another string in the public item in the constructor.    
The SQLiteDatabase2 java class has been modified to accommodate the new item in the database called ItemName.  First the new item was added as a string for the column in the database called COLUMN_2_ITEM_NAME.  Then the column was added to the table.  The item was added to the CRUD functionality within the SQLiteDatabase2.  This allowed the item name to be created, read, updated, and deleted within the database.  Within the application, I added intext citations to see the modified code.
I was able to meet the course objectives planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One.  I used my narrative of the proposed changes to come up with a plan to enhance the artifacts.  

## Reflection
During the process of enhancing the artifact, I learned more about how software design works and best practices.  I also learned how to keep code up to date by updating and debugging the application.  The challenges I faced were the fact that these projects have been created many months ago.  To be able to find and retrieve them was challenging.  Android Studio IDE is constantly undergoing updates.  These updates had to be applied and this also conflicts with prior code.  The IDE helps bring the code up to date but sometimes the legacy code conflicts with the new updated version.
