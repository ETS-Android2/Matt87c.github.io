## Professional Self-Assessment
Computer science has always been a passion of mine.  From an early age, I began my journey on an MS-Dos computer loading floppy discs and typing in the command line.  Today I am proficiant in full stacks development.  I obtained my bachelors degree in early 2022.  During this journey I have completed two internships.  The two internships were completed with Bankers Financial Corporation.  Within Bankers Financial Corporation I worked in two seperate branches within the corporation.  The first three months I worked with Bankers Insurance Group as an application developmer intern which deals with home insurances.  I worked on the agent and customer application.  This internship taught me a lot about how to work in development team with a Scrum Agile methodology.  I became proficient in git source control working with the developers and completeing the assigned stories.  The application was Angular development with API's.  I learned how to work on the application in C# and ASP.NET core development. Once my code was finished and tested, I created releases with Azure DevOps and would deploy these releases into the int, sqa, and prd environments.
