The employer and skill information about a particular job will be stored in classes themselves. These items themselves will hold their own supplementary information.
The Employer class extends AbstractEntity class.  Inheritance

The Employer field is a One-to-Many Relationship.  In this application, any one Job object is affiliated with one employer while one Employer may contain several jobs.  Within the Employer class the annotations @OneToManyand @JoinColumn are on the jobs list in Employer to declare the relationship between data tables
