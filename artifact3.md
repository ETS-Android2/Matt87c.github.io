# Artifact 2 - Databases
## What is this artifact?
The artifact is a data mining report for the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. The CSV file database is a collection of customer and restaurant information. The data mining report includes a statistical analysis with graphs to discover new information about the data that one may not see looking at the data itself. This artifact was created in April of 2021.

## Why did I select this artifact?
This artifact takes a csv file of data and uses JMP software to perform statistical analysis with graphs.  This information is useful for businesses to discover new information about their data one would normally not see within a csv file.  JMP software allows the data to be paired together and find relationships between the pairs.  All this can be helpful for businesses to make better decisions about their company.  This is exactly why I chose this artifact.  I find that this is a skill that can be beneficial to my career by helping other businesses enhance their marketing efforts.

## Enhancements
The first improvement of this artifact is with the CSV file database.  I noticed that the variable names could do better explaining the data.  I changed the names so the average person can understand how to read the data.  The data had abbreviated names which I changed to full words.  Also, the yes or no variables stored binary numbers.  The average user may not know this, so I changed the variable names to explain 1 is yes and 0 is no.

In the final project I updated the charts to read more data.  A fit mean line has been added to the bivariate fit chart showing website spending by restaurant.  This new line has identified that the average amount spend is $40.54 in the webstore.  The chart also shows a key that identifies what the lines are.  The next chart updated is the bivariate fit of webstore spending by income.  I also added a fit mean line here with a key on the chart.  The fit mean data shows the average spending.

The next enhancement is with the logistic fit chart between website purchases and website visits.  I updated the variable names and swapped the line which is more understandable.  The new variables are labeled to help the person viewing the chart understand if a website purchase was made with binary numbers.

The final enhancement is for the logistic fit chart comparing website purchases by restaurant number.  The chart has updated variables and I also changed the lines in the chart.  The data now shows a more organized line moving upward with the restaurant number.  The higher restaurants numbers show less purchases but more likely to spend in the webstore. 

## Reflection
I learned a lot about databases and how to mine the data with this enhancement.  The more I continue to create graphs and statistical analysis with the CSV files I learn new ways on how to pair the data.  The challenges I faced were the software used for this project is a SAS.  This means a software as a service and must be paid to use.
