# Artifact 1 - Software Design and Engineering
## What is this artifact?
The artifact chosen for Software Engineering/Design will be from the course IT-315 Object Orient Analysis/Design.  This class we designed a software for students and teachers to register for classes.  This included SIS sequence diagrams to show the process of the user interface.   This artifact was created in January of 2021.  

## Why did I select this artifact?
The IT 315 Object Orent Analysis/Design artifact was a great way to show that I am capable of understanding and designing software.  Before coding, to be able to put together a software design and how the software works is valuable to showcase to potential employers.  This artifact showcases my skills and abilities with software development by showing different types of software diagrams that show that I understand how the software functions.    

## Enhancements
I created a new diagram that is more organized and presents better overall.  The diagram that I enhanced is the Student Information System diagram.  Prior to the enhancements, the lines did not line up well and was not as neatly portraid as I would have liked.  I made these changes and now the diagrams all look neatly presentable.

## Reflection
During the process of enhancing the artifact, I learned more about how software design works and best practices.  The software design helps users to follow along and be able to understand how the software functions.  The challenges I faced were the fact that these projects have been created many months ago.  To be able to find and retrieve them was challenging.  Once I was able to recover the artifacts, I had to use the previous software I used to create this artifact.  Some of these softwareâ€™s are no longer available to me to use.  This poses as a challenge when enhancing the artifact.
