## Intro
My name is Matthew Clockel, and I have a bachelors degree in computer science with a major in software engineering from Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. I currently have completed two internships in application development with Centricity and Bankers Insurance Group.  I have been programming in many different languages for over four years.  

This ePortfolio will showcase three artifacts in:
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

## Professional Self-Assessment
  Computer science has always been a passion of mine.  From an early age, I began my journey on an MS-Dos computer loading floppy discs and typing in the command line.  Today I am proficiant in full stacks development.  I obtained my bachelors degree in early 2022.  During this journey I have completed two internships.  The two internships were completed with Bankers Financial Corporation.  Within Bankers Financial Corporation I worked in two seperate branches within the corporation.  The first three months I worked with Bankers Insurance Group as an application developmer intern which deals with home insurances.  I worked on the agent and customer application.  This internship taught me a lot about how to work in development team with a Scrum Agile methodology.  I became proficient in git source control working with the developers and completeing the assigned stories.  The application was Angular development with API's.  I learned how to work on the application in C# and ASP.NET core development. Once my code was finished and tested, I created releases with Azure DevOps and would deploy these releases into the int, sqa, and prd environments.
  
  The second internship with Bankers Financial Corporation was with Centricity branch.  This internship I worked with the development team which was also Scrum Agile.  The purpose of my internship was to help migrate legacy software into a new modern platform that will reduce the amount of work for the team.  The migration was to move the data into Airtables and Windward templates.  The Windward templates would be populated with the JSON databases that were stored in Airtables.  I had to commit my work using Git source control and also create releases in Azure DevOps. 
  
  I have also completed the Launchcode LC101 course.  This course was a full time six month classroom web development course that teaches full stack skills.  The curriculum included the foundational programming concepts and front-end programming in JavaScript with testing and Angular framework.  The course also taught full-stack web application development using java with Spring Boot frame work and C# with .NET MVC.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
This artifact is an android application that is an inventory application.  This inventory application has user authentication and credentials.  The inventory app also allows the user to add inventory items with CRUD functionality.  This artifact uses two SQLite databases to store user and inventory item information.  This artifact was created in October of 2021.

## Databases
 The artifact is a data mining report for the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company.  The CSV file database is a collection of customer and restaurant information.  The data mining report includes a statistical analysis with graphs to discover new information about the data that one may not see looking at the data itself.  This artifact was created in April of 2021.
